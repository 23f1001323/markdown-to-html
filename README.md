Save the files: Ensure index.html and input.md are saved in the same directory. 2. Open index.html: Simply open index.html in your web browser. The application will automatically fetch input.md, convert its content to HTML, and display it. ## Technologies Used * HTML5: Structure of the web page. * Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling. * JavaScript: For fetching input.md and dynamically rendering content. * Marked.js: A fast markdown parser and compiler written in JavaScript. ## License This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
